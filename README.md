# Mercer-Coding-Camp


This project was part of a Mercer on Mission to South Africa, led by Dr. Robert Allen. My team created lesson plans and interactive code exercises to teach 3rd through 12th graders computer science principles. 

I led interactive lessons using music theory with Georgia Tech developed software EarSketch with the older students. With the younger students, we practiced composing music to illustrate writing functions in code. 

Most importantly, I led lessons on using an interactive LED light board built by Dr. Allen. We used a Rasberry Pi to interface with the lights, and wrote python functions to display patterns on the board. It was a great way to teach the kids python!
