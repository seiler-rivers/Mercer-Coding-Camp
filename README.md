# Mercer-Coding-Camp

This project was part of a Mercer on Mission to South Africa, led by Dr. Robert Allen. My team created lesson plans and interactive code exercises to teach 3rd through 12th graders computer science principles. 

I led interactive lessons using music theory with Georgia Tech developed software EarSketch with the older students. With the younger students, we practiced composing music to illustrate writing functions in code. 

### LED Light Board
Most importantly, I led lessons on using an interactive LED light board built by Dr. Allen. We used a Rasberry Pi to interface with the lights, and wrote python functions to display patterns on the board. It was a great way to teach the kids python!
